                            <div class="whitespace"></div>
                            <p>Typically mid to high fidelity, mockups reflect the design choices for color schemes, layouts, typography, iconography, the visuals of navigation, and the overall atmosphere of the product. </p>
                            <p>In addition to setting aside time to answer the important visual questions, mockups have several other benefits: </p>
                            <ul>
                            <li><p>Intuitive to stakeholders &mdash; Thanks to their higher fidelity, mockups require less context than lo-fi documents like wireframes. Stakeholders can more easily see the final product.</p></li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul>
                            <li><p>Realistic perspective &mdash; It&rsquo;s one thing to have all your visual decisions made, but it&rsquo;s another to see them all working together in a way close to the real thing. Mockups can help reveal problems that aren&rsquo;t so apparent on paper (for example, color clashes, or smaller type crimes going unnoticed).</p></li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul>
                            <li><p>Early revisions &mdash; It&rsquo;s easier to make revisions in a mockup than in the later coding stages (as long as the mockup itself isn&rsquo;t coded).</p></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In the design process, mockups come at the end of the lo-fi phase and the beginning of the hi-fi phase. This could mean different things for different methods &mdash; for example, a mockup could be made immediately after wireframing, or could be postponed until after some lo-fi prototype testing. </p>
                            <p>We also recommend testing when transitioning from lo-fi to hi-fi, however. Big picture concepts like navigation and flow are harder to change in high fidelity, and so should be iterated before you dive into a hi-fi mockup.</p>

                            <p>Guerrilla Usability Testing</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <h4>Description</h4>
                            <p>It is a <strong>quick</strong> and <strong>cheap</strong> way of testing a prototype or feature with real users.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p><strong><em>Martin Belam</em></strong> defined guerrilla testing as&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;The art of pouncing on lone people in cafes and public spaces, and quickly filming them whilst they use a website or app for a couple of minutes.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>Participants are approached in <strong>public places</strong> and asked to take part in the research. Every time is done in a <strong>different place</strong> and each session normally lasts for only <strong>10-15 minutes</strong> with a small incentive of a coffee or cake offered. It is important to test a <strong>variety of users</strong> in different places, because of the psychology of human nature. We are influenced by the environment, in which we are placed. There are plenty of methods for conducting UX testing, but many of these testing methods are resource-intensive and time-consuming.</p>
                            <h4>GUERRILLA is great for:&nbsp;</h4>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li><p>Identifying critical usability issues early in a product design lifecycle.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Testing assumptions during the design process. Guerrilla testing can be an easy way to create validation checkpoints.&nbsp;</p></li>
                            <li><p>Validating tasks that don&rsquo;t require specific knowledge (ordering a product in an e-commerce store).&nbsp;</p></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <h4>DISADVANTAGES</h4>
                            <ul>
                            <li><p>A specific environment is required to conduct testing.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Requires specific knowledge to use a product (financial or medical applications). We can&rsquo;t expect all the people to have all the required skills.</p></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <h4>FIRST TEST</h4>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>We started with Roberta for our first test.&nbsp; She is a student, who was struggling with her team to come up with an idea for their project. We got her unprepared, but as we know this is the idea in guerrilla&nbsp;testing. She started with the login page. Sometimes it is annoying&nbsp;to have a login page, so as to function in the future developing process we should add an option for no login. There was a problem to choose, which activity she wants to do because some of the icons didn't work properly. For&nbsp;example, the icon with the bus and the train. She wanted to get a ticket for a train but at this part of the developing, we decided to focus on the most important, which is getting a ticket for a plane or booking a hotel. Everything else was so easy for her. Even the payment part, which we thought might be a little complicated, she easily managed to pass. As a&nbsp;result, her satisfaction was 8 all of 10, which as far as I can tell is a good result. She loved the design, even the colors, which we decided to be not offending, insulting, confronting in any human aspect. In fact, the purple in a psychological manner, we had chosen, it is a color that balances red and blue. Red tends to bring intensity and energy, while blue brings relaxation and stability and together they create a perfect colorful environment for our users.</p>

                            <h4>SECOND TEST</h4>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Our second tester is a girl from Fontys University too. Her name is Nour she is from Arabic origin, 18&nbsp;years old, very friendly, out-going person, who was a little bit too excited. She didn't talk at all, which is a drawback for this type of testing, but as far as we got from&nbsp;her she was struggling with too much congestion, crowding of some of the frames. At first, it was very difficult for her to oriented&nbsp;inside the application, but after then she managed to pass through all the frames easily and without&nbsp;problems.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <h4>FEEDBACK</h4>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li><p>The app should be more specific and less complicated</p></li>
                            <li><p>Some of the users were struggling with crowded information &ndash; less information means better user experience in the case of this application</p></li>
                            <li><p>There should have an option for none login users</p></li>
