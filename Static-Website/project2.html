                                <h4>Observation for Research&nbsp;</h4>
                                <ol>
                                <li> Identify Object&nbsp;</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>With this observation, the idea is to find the potential weaknesses of the website &ldquo;BlaBlaCar&rdquo; so that we can propose fixes for a better user experience process. In this observation, we have chosen to video all people in order to not lose any specific detail. When we conduct the observation part we tried to identify all the reactions, behaviors, etalons and habits of the users and the general information about people in particular environment, which we put them in, so that we can better understand what they do and, hopefully, why they do it.&nbsp;</p>
                                <ol start="2">
                                <li> Establishing the Recording Methodology&nbsp;</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>We have chosen a quiet room, well ventilated, but with all needed so that we can provide a warm, environment for the user to focus on the task. So we minimize and eliminate all the disturbing electronic devices, which the user should not be familiar with. In order to escape the ethical problem of not telling the users that we film them, we carefully talked with them before that actual interview/observation part. We could use the method of note-taking, but in order to not disturb the user with our writing, we have chosen to just record them.&nbsp;</p>
                                <ol start="3">
                                <li> Develop Questions and Techniques&nbsp;</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>We decided to create an informal observation, which is conducted with a little concept about what to expect and we simply observed the people in order to learn about their behaviors. We stayed next to them with completely open mind, hoping to gain some insights. We asked them to do one task and to give us feedback about their user experience.&nbsp;</p>
                                <ol start="4">
                                <li> Observations and Conclusions&nbsp;</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>ROBERTA&rsquo;s INTERVIEW&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>In our first interview, the person was really pleased with the actual interface of the application. Her name is Roberta. She is an ICT student at Fontys University and she is 19 years old. Roberta has never used or heard about the BlaBlaCar application so it was her first time.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>What kind of problem as the first impression she faced, was the difficulty to find the language settings. Her reaction was to scroll to the bottom of the page, where is actually the button to change the settings, but she could not find it. She told us that because of the current dutch language she could not orientate easily. She was searching for the button somewhere on the top of the page. When she changed the language she was linked to a UK version of the site.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Then we began with the next part of our observation/interview process, which was to ask her to order a car as the main functionality of this site is that you can order cars easily.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Roberta had no problems with the interface of the next steps, but she was asked to make a registration after the actual ordering of the car, which made her a bit of nervous, because she was thinking that she will lose her data information, about the current order and had to pass through the whole process again. When she got to the list of all the available cars, she got confused about how to choose one because there is no exact button to select a car, but instead you should click on the whole box, which might be a problem for the user, but as far as I believe this is a modern design solution and it works. There was a shadow around the box, which helps the user to understand that she has selected the current item.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>One major drawback was that the driver details were completely on his/her native language. So in order to reserve a car as a tourist or English speaker you should somehow translate the driver&rsquo;s details. In order to escape this thing, the app should expect users to write in English too.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>We asked Roberta about her feedback:&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>&ldquo;In the beginning, I was disorientated with the language.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>&ldquo;I personally expected to find the setting in the upper navigation bar. I don&rsquo;t know why but probably placed somewhere. Otherwise, it seemed straight forward. There was a lot of work to sign in so that you can have an account, but probably you are going to use it often, so it is worth it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>&ldquo;I like that you can find or/and offer a ride and it was not that hard once I could switch to English. In some places, the font size was too small. It was easier for me just to go back. And one last thing I didn&rsquo;t like but know I am looking at it. I don&rsquo;t know if it was only for car order, but the information/details were in dutch so it doesn&rsquo;t really work for me. Actually, it works fine it wasn&rsquo;t that hard for me! I am pleased with it! &rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
